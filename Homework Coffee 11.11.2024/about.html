            <h2>1. Types of Coffee</h2>
                <h3>1.1 Americano</h3>
                    <img src="images/americano.png" alt="An image of a specific type of coffee named Americano">
                        <p>The Americano is one of the best types of coffee known for its simplicity and intense flavor. It originated during World War II when American soldiers stationed in Italy diluted their espresso with hot water, as they wanted something resembling the black Coffee they used to drink. A caffè Americano is an espresso topped with hot water and can be made in several ways. You can find an Americano at almost any cafe in America and worldwide. An Americano usually smells good, even more than regular coffee. This brewing technique involves adding hot water to a shot of espresso, resulting in a milder, larger beverage. A higher concentration of caffeine in the coffee gives the Americano a fuller-bodied texture and a richer taste.</p>
                <h3>1.2 Bulletproof Coffee</h3>            
                    <img src="images/bulletproof.png" alt="An image of two cups of coffee with two spoons, one filled with oil and the second one with a butter cube">
                        <p>Bulletproof coffee is a trendy beverage known for its unique ingredients and potential health benefits. It’s made by blending high-quality coffee with grass-fed butter and MCT (medium-chain triglyceride) oil. The concept behind bulletproof coffee is to provide sustained energy and mental clarity throughout the day. Grass-fed butter adds richness and creaminess to the coffee while providing essential fats. MCT oil, derived from coconut oil, contains medium-chain triglycerides rapidly converted into energy by the body. Together, these ingredients create a frothy and indulgent coffee drink with a smooth texture and satisfying flavor. Bulletproof coffee enthusiasts claim it helps boost cognitive function, promote weight loss, and increase energy levels. However, consuming it in moderation and as part of a balanced diet is essential to reap its potential benefits.</p>

                    <img src="images/cafe au lait.png" alt="An image of a normal cup of coffee">
                        <p>Café au lait is a coffee beverage from France, made with equal parts of strong, hot coffee and steamed milk. The name “Café au Lait” is French for “coffee with milk,” straightforwardly emphasizing its main ingredients.Café au Lait is commonly consumed in the morning and is famous in French cafes and households. The brewing technique involves preparing a robust drip of coffee and then blending it with an equal amount of milk that has been steamed to create a creamy texture. The result is a well-balanced beverage with the richness of coffee complemented by the smoothness of steamed milk.</p>

            <h2>2. History of Coffee</h2>
            <p>The history of coffee dates back centuries, first from its origin in Ethiopia and later in Yemen. It was already known in Mecca in the 15th century. Also, in the 15th century, Sufi monasteries in Yemen employed coffee as an aid to concentration during prayers. Coffee later spread to the Levant in the early 16th century; it caused some controversy on whether it was halal in Ottoman and Mamluk society. Coffee arrived in Italy the second half of the 16th century through commercial Mediterranean trade routes, while Central and Eastern Europeans learned of coffee from the Ottomans. By the mid 17th century, it had reached India and the East Indies. Coffeepot (cafetière "campanienne"), part of a service, 1836, hard-paste porcelain, Metropolitan Museum of Art. Coffee houses were established in Western Europe by the late 17th century, especially in Holland, England, and Germany. One of the earliest cultivations of coffee in the New World was when Gabriel de Clieu brought coffee seedlings to Martinique in 1720. These beans later sprouted 18,680 coffee trees which enabled its spread to other Caribbean islands such as Saint-Domingue and also to Mexico. By 1788, Saint-Domingue supplied half the world's coffee.</p>

            <h2>3. Coffee Beans</h2>
            <h3>3.1 Arabica</h3>
                <p>Arabica beans are often considered superior in taste and dominate the specialty coffee market. Arabica beans are a single-origin coffee known for their flavors and grow at higher elevations. An Arabica shrub grows up to 15 feet (5m) tall but is usually pruned to about 6 feet (2m) to make it more commercially viable. Despite containing less caffeine than Robusta, Arabica tends to have a smooth, mild acidity and notes of fruit. Blends often feature Arabica for a well-balanced and aromatic cup.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Growing Regions</b>: Arabica beans are grown at higher altitudes in regions with cooler temperatures. Key Arabica-producing countries include Ethiopia, Colombia, Brazil, Costa Rica, and Kenya.</li>
                        <li><b>Flavor Profile</b>: Arabica beans are renowned for their complex flavors, including fruit notes, floral tones, and mild acidity.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
            <h3>3.2 Robusta</h3>
                    <p>Robusta coffee beans are resilient, high in caffeine, and grow in low-altitude regions. Robusta is a stouter plant about twice the size of Arabica and grows well in higher humidity. Robusta’s bold, earthy taste with a hint of bitterness makes it ideal for espresso blends, adding depth and an intense kick to the cup. It is an excellent option for those who prefer intense flavors in their morning cup.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Growing Regions</b>: Robusta beans are typically grown in lower-altitude areas with warmer temperatures. Major Robusta-producing countries include Vietnam, Brazil, Indonesia, and parts of Africa.</li>
                        <li><b>Flavor Profile</b>: Robusta beans are known for their bold, earthy taste, higher caffeine content, and a hint of bitterness. They are often used to add depth to espresso blends.</li>

            <h2>4. Coffee Brewing</h2>
            <h3>4.1 The French Press</h3>
            <img src="images/frenchpress.png" alt="An image of a French Press">
                <p>A french press features a cylindrical glass carafe with a mesh filter inside which separates the ground coffee from the hot water. When it’s time to pour and serve, a lever is pushed down which strains and separates the coffee grounds from the brewed coffee, leaving the grounds on the bottom and liquid coffee above the filter. Before brewing with a french press coffee maker, coffee should be ground to a medium or coarse grind to obtain the best flavor possible. This also prevents any grounds from passing through the filter.</p>

            <h3>4.2 The Cold Brew method</h3>    
            <img src="images/coldbrew.png" alt="An image of a pitcher of coffee made with the cold brew method">
            <p>The process for making cold brew coffee is a lot different than standard brewing. First of all, the coffee is steeped in cold or room temperature water instead of hot water. The steeping process itself lasts for an extended period, usually overnight. This style of brewing produces coffee that’s highly concentrated with higher amounts of caffeine than drip coffee.</p>

            <h3>4.3 Coffee Bags</h3>
            <img src="images/coffeebags.png" alt="An image of someone making coffee using a coffee bag">
            <p>If you’re looking to make your coffee brewing experience as easy as brewing tea, you may be interested in the coffee bag method. This method uses coffee grounds inside of soft pouches similar to tea bags.</p>
